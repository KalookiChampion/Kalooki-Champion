### Card Values (for 40-point opening)

| Card | Points |
|------|--------|
| Ace | 15 |
| K, Q, J, 10 | 10 each |
| 9 down to 2 | Face value |
| Joker | 25 |

### Game Flow

1. **Each player receives 13 cards** from two shuffled decks (106 cards total)

2. **On your turn:**
   - First, **DRAW** a card (from deck OR pack)
   - Then, optionally **PLAY** melds or add to existing melds
   - Finally, **DISCARD** one card to end your turn

3. **First Meld Requirement:**
   - Your first meld(s) must total at least **40 points**
   - After meeting this requirement, click the **IN** button
   - Once "IN", you can add cards to anyone's melds

4. **Valid Melds:**
   - **SET**: 3-4 cards of the same rank, different suits (e.g., 7♠ 7♥ 7♦)
   - **RUN**: 3+ consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 4♥ 5♥ 6♥)

5. **Jokers:**
   - Jokers are wild and can represent any card
   - Maximum 1 Joker per set, 2 Jokers per run
   - You can swap a Joker from any meld if you have the matching natural card

6. **Winning:**
   - First player to discard their last card wins!
   - The winning player discards and has 0 cards remaining

### Special Rules

- **Pack Draw Rule**: If you draw from the pack (discard pile), you MUST use that card in a meld before discarding
- **Elimination**: If you draw from the pack and can't make 40 points, you're eliminated!
- **Goers**: Cards you add to existing melds glow yellow temporarily

## Card Actions

### Drawing Cards

**From the Deck (face-down pile):**
- Double-click the deck
- You get a random card
- Safe option - no restrictions

**From the Pack (discard pile):**
- Double-click the top card (it glows yellow when available)
- You MUST use this card in a meld
- Risky but strategic

### Playing Melds

1. **Arrange cards in your hand** by dragging them
2. **Drag 3+ cards** to your meld area (below your hand)
3. Cards automatically group into sets/runs
4. Make sure your first melds total 40+ points
5. Click **IN** to lock in your opening melds

### Adding to Existing Melds (Goers)

After you're "IN":
- Drag a single card onto any player's existing meld
- The card must extend the meld legally
- Example: Add a 4♠ to an existing 5♠ 6♠ 7♠ run

### Joker Swaps

You can take a Joker from any meld if you have the right card:
- **For Sets**: Provide a card of the same rank with a missing suit
- **For Runs**: Provide the exact card the Joker represents

**How Joker Swaps Work:**
1. Drag your matching card onto the Joker in any meld
2. Your card goes into that meld, the Joker moves to YOUR meld area (orange glow)
3. Add more cards from your hand to the Joker to form a valid 3+ card meld
4. **To Undo**: Double-click the orange-glowing Joker group
5. When you discard, the Joker meld becomes permanent (must be valid!)
